Description: # PyScanCf
        
        Creates PyArt compatible cf-radial data from single scans of IMD Radar data
        
        ## Description
        
        PyScanCf is a library for creating cfradial (polar) data from IMD radars that contain all 10 sweeps from single scans which are named as (Polar_ABC.nc) as well as gridded radar data from which are named as (grid_ABC.nc). Both formats are compatible for PyART. It uses Pyart to create grid data, so please remember to cite pyart as well.
