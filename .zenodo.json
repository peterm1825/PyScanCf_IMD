Both formats are compatible for PyART. It uses Pyart to create grid data, so please remember to cite pyart as well.</p>\n\n<p>Installing from source</p>\n\n<p>Installing PyScanCf from source is the only way to get the latest updates and enhancement to the software that have not yet made it into a release.
